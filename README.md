Work in progress!

This project was made for the course "Master Project Social Data Science" at the RWTH Aachen.
The project consists out of several scripts that build on each other, besides their title the order is denoted through the number upfront in the script name. 

Further theoretical background, reasoning and interpretation will be provided by the end of January through a Report as well as a Summary in this readme.
